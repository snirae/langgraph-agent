  EXAMPLE:
  ### QUESTION
  In which year did the publisher of Roald Dahl’s Guide to Railway Safety cease to exist?
  ### References
  Roald Dahl’s Guide to Railway Safety was published in 1991 by the British Railways Board.
  The British Railways Board had asked Roald Dahl to write the text of the booklet, and
  Quentin Blake to illustrate it, to help young people enjoy using the railways safely. The
  British Railways Board (BRB) was a nationalised industry in the United Kingdom that
  operated from 1963 to 2001. Until 1997 it was responsible for most railway services in Great
  Britain, trading under the brand name British Railways and, from 1965, British Rail. It
  did not operate railways in Northern Ireland, where railways were the responsibility of the
  Government of Northern Ireland.
